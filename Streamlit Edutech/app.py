    **How is 'Academic Success Level' Calculated?**
    The 'Academic Success Level' is determined by an **Academic Success Score**,

    Here's a breakdown of the calculation:
    
    1.  **Total Credits Attempted:**
        * `Total_Credits_Attempted` = `Curricular units 1st sem enrolled` + `Curricular units 2nd sem enrolled`
        
    2.  **Total Credits Approved:**
        * `Total_Credits_Approved` = `Curricular units 1st sem approved` + `Curricular units 2nd sem approved`
        
    3.  **Approval Rate:**
        * `Approval_Rate` = `Total_Credits_Approved` / `Total_Credits_Attempted`
        
    4.  **Average Grade:**
        * `Average_Grade` = (`Curricular units 1st sem grade` + `Curricular units 2nd sem grade`) / 2
        
    5.  **Academic Success Score:**
        * `Academic_Success_Score` = `Approval_Rate` * `Average_Grade`
        
    Finally, your 'Academic Success Level' is categorized as follows:
    
    * **Excellent:** If `Academic_Success_Score` >= 15
    * **Good:** If `Academic_Success_Score` >= 10
    * **Low:** If `Academic_Success_Score` > 0 and < 10
    * **No Performance:** If `Academic_Success_Score` is 0 (or undefined due to no credits attempted/approved)

    Here's the breakdown of how it's calculated:

    Your 'Financial Risk' level is an indicator of potential financial challenges

    Here's the calculation and what each component means:

    * **Debtor Status:**
        * This is a binary value (0 or 1).
        * **1** if you are classified as a debtor (meaning you have outstanding payments).

        * **1** if your tuition fees are up-to-date.
        * **0** if your tuition fees are NOT up-to-date.
        * In the calculation, we use `(1 - Tuition_fees_up_to_date)` so that a '0' (not up-to-date) contributes to the risk.

    The **Financial Risk Score** is calculated as:
    `Financial_Risk_Score` = `Debtor` + (1 - `Tuition_fees_up_to_date`)

    This score will result in one of three values (0, 1, or 2), which are then mapped to a risk level:

    * **0: Financially Safe**
        * This means you are not a debtor AND your tuition fees are up-to-date.
    * **1: Moderate Risk**
        * This indicates one of the following: you are a debtor, OR your tuition fees are not up-to-date.
    * **2: High Risk**

    **How is 'Macroeconomic Stress Level' Determined?**
    Your 'Macroeconomic Stress Level' is an indicator that assesses the impact of broader 
    economic conditions on your academic environment. It's calculated using key economic indicators: 
    **Unemployment Rate**, **Inflation Rate**, and **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**.

    **Understanding the Components:**

    Before combining them, each of these economic indicators is first **normalized**. 
    This means their values are scaled to a range between 0 and 1, making them comparable 
    regardless of their original units or scales. This normalization is done using a 
    min-max scaling method:

    $Normalized\\_Value = (Current\\_Value - Minimum\\_Value) / (Maximum\\_Value - Minimum\\_Value)$

    Once normalized:

    * **Unemployment Rate:** A higher unemployment rate generally indicates more economic stress.
    * **Inflation Rate:** A higher inflation rate signifies rising costs and typically points to increased economic stress.
    * **GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** GDP represents the total economic output. A higher GDP usually suggests a healthier economy, thus reducing stress.

    **Calculating the Macroeconomic Stress Level:**

    The `Macroeconomic_Stress_Level` is derived from these normalized values using the following formula:

    `Macroeconomic_Stress_Level` = `Normalized Unemployment Rate` + `Normalized Inflation Rate` - `Normalized GDP`

    **Interpreting Your Macroeconomic Stress Level:**

    Based on the calculated score (let's call it 'msi' for macroeconomic stress index), 
    your macroeconomic environment is categorized as:

    * **Low Stress:** If the `msi` score is $<$ 5.
    * **Moderate Stress:** If the `msi` score is between 5 (inclusive) and $<$ 10.
    * **High Stress:** If the `msi` score is $\\geq$ 10.
